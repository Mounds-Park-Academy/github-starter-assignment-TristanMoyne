Nuclear Power is crucial for our world, from the power plants to the sun so it's crucial to how we live. Nuclear power is easily divided into 2 different reactions, fusion and fission. Fission is the nuclear reaction we use the most today, it happens when a neutron hits a heavy atom like uranium 235 (which is the most commonly used atom). The atom spilts and causes a chain reaction splitting more atoms which can lead to the energy being transferred into heat, heating up water, releasing steam, moving a turbine thus creating electricity. The other way this energy can be transferred is in nuclear weapons, where the fission reaction will create a large ball of fire, vaporizing everything in its vicinity
